This is a very simple script to download the latest copy of Drupal and install and configure it for first time use. There are many assumptions made about the configuration of the Mac and I will try my best to list them below.

Assumptions: 
 - Stock OSX Apache installation and configuration
 - Stock OSX PHP installation configuration
 - Apache is configured to allow user directories in the form of http://localhost/~USERNAME/
 - Apache is configured to allow .htaccess files to override existing configs.
 - Git must be installed and part of the PATH environment variable.
 - Drush must be installed and part of the PATH environment variable.
 - MySQL must be installed and part of the PATH environment variable.
 - MySQL
